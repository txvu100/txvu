ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Trinh Vu.

Computer Science student at the University of Central Oklahoma. \
In my spare time, I'm working on my garage lab that includes several exciting projects. \
I named it 3AM Lab (Get it? It's my productive time). The ultimate idea is to automate any tedious tasks that I can think of. \
Hopefully, it will help other people and me save some time to pursue whatever hobby we've been fantasizing about.

Happy coding!!!
